The mode argument used in both the fs.chmod() and fs.chmodSync() methods is a numeric bitmask created using a logical OR of the following constants:
fs.constants.S_IRUSR	0o400	read by owner //'S' stands for 'status'
fs.constants.S_IWUSR	0o200	write by owner
fs.constants.S_IXUSR	0o100	execute/search by owner
fs.constants.S_IRGRP	0o40	read by group
fs.constants.S_IWGRP	0o20	write by group
fs.constants.S_IXGRP	0o10	execute/search by group
fs.constants.S_IROTH	0o4	read by others
fs.constants.S_IWOTH	0o2	write by others
fs.constants.S_IXOTH	0o1	execute/search by others
